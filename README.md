Hi!

If you are reading this, this is a placeholder for a future project's documentation. Upfront is a web-based chat-room that uses Laravel's websockets and Docker containers. The aim of this project, as most others here,
is to showcase personal knowledge regarding these technologies.

Stay tuned :^)
